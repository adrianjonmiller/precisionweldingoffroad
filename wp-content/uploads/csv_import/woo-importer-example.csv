Bomb Proof Toyota Motor Mounts,186040-1-K,95,10,"part# 186040-1-K
 
 Anyone who has dual cases with 4.70 gears in their Toyota rock crawler has at one time or another broken an OEM rubber motor mount and heard the awful sound of their fan blades hitting their radiator or worse. We at Trail-Gear have an answer for that problem, we call it our Bomb Proof Motor Mount Kit. We feel so confident about this product that we back it up with our world famous No Questions Asked Lifetime Warranty.
 
 The base of the motor mount (frame side) is made out of 1/4 inch plate, while the surface plate that the motor sits on is made out of 3/8 inch material and has a class 10.9 bolt that is mechanically locked to the engine mount plate, not just threaded in. We made the bushings out of a high grade polyurethane for durability and years of dependability. The finish is a black zinc plating that looks sharp and will last a lifetime. The mount holes are slotted so that the Bomb Proof Motor Mount Kit is easy to install and can be used on 3.5 inch and 3.75 inch applications.† You don?t even have to measure to figure out what motor you have; our Bomb Proof Motor Mount Kit just works.

Creepy Twin Twin Stick Shifter For Toyota Forward Shifter,107507-1-K,159,4,"part# 107507-1-K
 
 Twin stick shifters allow independent control of the high/low and 2wd/4wd sections of your Toyota gear driven transfer case. This allows access to low range 2wd operation. It also allows you to shift in and out of 4wd while driving on the trail without the need to stop. Access to 2wd low range allows easier steering and less driveline binding when you are traveling between obstacles on the trail.
 
 Twin shifters come fully assembled and ready to install. Before installing the Creepy Twin shifter, it is necessary to remove the interlock pin from the transfer case to allow independent operation of the shift rails. Once the pin has been removed, the Twin Shifter can be bolted on to the top of the transfer case.
 
 Shifter bases are made from polished cast aluminum. Shifter keys are made from heat treated 1020 steel. The internal cross pin is made from heat treated chromolly steel.
 
 A splash resistant oil breather is installed on the top of the shifter to reduce oil loss in a roll over while still allowing the transfer case to vent as needed. Each lever is sealed with an o-ring for long, trouble free operation.
 
 Twin Stick shifters are shipped with one 4.70 and one 2wd/4wd shift knob. The 4.70 knob may be substituted for a 2.28 knob upon request. (talk to your sales person or make a note in the notes section if ordering online). A new cork shifter gasket is included with the kit. Reuse stock shifter base mounting bolt to attach to transfer case.

 Trail-Gear now offers its own dual transfer case kit for Toyota Pickup and 4Runner applications. Matt Messer has produced thousands of doublers for other off-road companies and over the years has looked at how to improve the quality and price. The result of that effort is the Trail-Creeper? dual adapter.
 
 Trail-Gear believes that you won't find a better, more reliable product anywhere, at any price. We have greatly increased the oiling flow in and around the adapter for cooler operation. We have increased the strength of the casting by making thicker walls and creating huge oversized gussets. A special retainer ring securely stabilizes the main bearing to prevent bearing play. Other adapters in the market only use a light gauge snap ring to hold the bearing in place. Tight tolerances on the coupler ensure long life and prevent striped out input gears.
 
 Installation requires an additional top shifting Toyota gear-driven transfer case, drive shaft modifications, and floorboard modifications. Assembled dual adapter unit is 6.5"" long. In stock and ready to ship.

3.0 Toyota V-6 Adapter Plate For Gear Driven Case,100086-1-K,310,10,"part# 100086-1-K
 
 This adapter plate allows one or more gear driven transfer case(s) to be bolted up to 1988-1995 Toyota 3.0L V6 5 speed transmissions. Our updated design does not require modification to the transmission for installation thanks to the use of countersunk mounting hardware. Another exclusive feature is the use of all nine transmission mounting bolts on both single and dual case installations.
 
 With our V6 adapter plate you can install the legendary Toyota gear driven transfer case(s) in your trail rig. These cases are known for their strength, reliability and configuration flexibility. With the correct adapter plate you can put one, two or even three transfer cases into your truck. Each case can have stock 2.28 gears or 4.70 low range gears installed.
 
 Extensive vehicle modifications are required for installation including: retubing both front and rear drive shafts, additional floorboard hole for the second transfer case shifter, speedometer cable extension, and crossmember replacement.
 
 <strong>Note:</strong> One top shift case will be needed to perform this conversion, for duals, both cases need to be top shift.

 For rock crawling, lower transfer case gears give you the control you need to keep your truck on track. Trail-Gear offers an affordable 4.70:1 gear kit for your gear driven Toyota transfer case. Trail-Creeper T-Case gears are available in 21 and 23 spline configurations. Kits include replacement gears, gaskets and seals. Disassembly and modification of transfer case is required for installation. Input gears are precision ground &amp; micro-polished to guarantee the removal of all surface imperfections in the forging.
 
 Trail-Creeper gears fit Toyota 4WD Pickup's and 4Runners from 1979-1995 with gear drive style transfer cases. Gear sets reduce the stock low range from 2.28 to 4.70, nearly twice the the reduction of the stock gears. High range is not affected and remains 1 to 1. Each gear set carries a full lifetime guarantee. If your gears ever fail to function properly, simply return them to us for replacement.
 
 V6 applications require the transfer case be replaced with a 4Cyl gear drive unit and V6 Adapter plate. Speedo cable, floorboard, drive shaft, and crossmember changes may also be required.",No,Transmission/Transfer Case|Low Gear Sets|Vehicle Brands|Toyota|Transmission/Transfer Case,http://precisionweldingoffroad:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/470gear-2251.jpg

 The PT-15 holds 50% more air than the PT-10. This is nice when you only have room or the budget for one tank. Instead of shooting 1500 #8D nails (10#) shoot 2300 #8D nails with this larger tank. The added capacity is more economical since the fill cost is the same as filling the 10 lb. size. And at 36 lb., it's still very easily portable. The photo shows the optional black tank boot at the base of the tank. This Tank is just 30"" tall including the handle. Scroll below for optional components.

 For some of you, a Power Tank needs to be more mobile and you don't need a metal hard-mount bracket. Instead, you would rather tote your Power Tank around and transport it in a padded Speed Bag. You know who you are; race track guys, construction carpenters, RVers, etc. Well if this is you then here's the perfect solution - the Track Pack Systems. This one includes the 10# Power Tank system, the Speed Bag, and the tank boot. The unique design of the Speed Bag allows the hose to stay attached while the Power Tank remains inside the bag. Pull the hose out of the hose pocket, turn on your Power Tank, and you're ready to go.

 This winch gives you 12,000 lbs. of pulling capacity with an increased duty cycle ? the secret is its innovative cooling system. Here?s how it works: The specially designed cooling fan (which is mounted under the vehicle?s hood) automatically turns on when the winch?s motor reaches a certain temperature. The fan forces air through a hose and directly into the winch?s motor housing, cooling the motor.The air then flows out of the motor housing via a second hose and is discharged. The Endurance 12.0 has other outstanding features including a heavy-duty contactor for increased durability and reliability, and a high-speed, three-stage planetary gear train for fast, smooth, and dependable operation. For the ultimate in good looks and corrosion resistance, the Rated winch wears a durable, glossy-black powder-coated finish. Much of the hardware, including the clutch lever, is stainless steel for added protection against the elements. The Endurance 12.0 also features extreme-duty winch sealing to keep the elements out. And, because this is a WARN winch, it has a limited lifetime warranty backed by a world-wide service organization.",No,Winches|Warn winches|Winches,http://precisionweldingoffroad:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/653.jpg

 The Rock-Assault? Ram Steering assist kit is the best kit you will find anywhere! Our Toyota kit features a 6"" X 1.5"" stroke hydraulic ram with high temp inner and outer seals for long life and no leaks. Our specially designed ram features a 3/4"" rod that is 50% stronger than other 1/2"" rods on the market. For Dana knuckle applications we also offer an 8"" stroke version.
 
 Our specially formed, easy to install brackets make installing our kit a breeze. If you have looked at other kits on the market, you will see they either don't include mounts or they just provide generic tabs. Our mounting hardware is specially designed to fit the Toyota axle and High Steer. Once the steering box has been tapped, installation of the ram takes about one hour. Each bracket is formed from heavy-duty 1/4"" plate steel for extra strength. Fits 1979 - 1995 Toyota Pickup and 4Runner with solid front axle.

Tie Rod Kit For Double Ended Ram,130291-1-K,145,14,"part# 130291-1-K
 
 Trail-Gear has made the perfect kit for building tie rod links for use with a double-ended ram. Based on our testing and experience with kits like these, we know that the failure point is always in the tie rod ends, which is why Trail-Gear uses only our own brand of Chromo Rod Ends. The main body of each rod end is 100% 4340 chromoly, and the ball of each rod end is made out of AISI 52100 material and then hard chrome-plated for an extremely tough finish.† We also added tie rod tubing that is 100% seamless DOM, and to top it off the weld in bungs are machined out of solid billet. With these components in place we feel that this kit is so strong it stands apart from every other kit on the market.
 
 This kit is also perfect match for our Rock Assault? Double Ended Ram and Clevis Kits.
 
 Kit includes:
 <ul>
 	<li>(2) Tie rod tubing (100% DOM)</li>
 	<li>(2) Right-hand threaded rod ends (Chromoly)</li>

"10"" Double Ended Ram And Clevis Kit",130283-1-K,319,31,"part# 130283-1-K
 
 Through years of research, development, and testing Trail-Gear has developed their double ended ram to meet the tough demands of top level rock crawling competitors and the toughest trails in the world. Based on our experience we knew exactly what we wanted in a ram, and what we didn't.
 
 Most rams on the market only have one rod seal.† We started with the primary and secondary rod seal to insure that fluid leakage would never be an issue.† We also included two wiper seals in our design to make sure that dirt and debris stay on the trail and don't get into your steering system. In addition, we designed our ram with a Triple Lip Piston Seal for consistent steering with no drift or fluid bypassing the piston.
 
 In true Trail-Gear style we also had to make our ram the strongest on the market, so we added a feature that you will not see on any other ram on the market.† We designed ours with a piston wear band and a rod bushing.† The bushing allows the rod to absorb much higher side loads.† We also machined our piston shaft out of a single piece of 4340 chromoly.† Other rams on the market use a two-piece welded or threaded piston shaft that can fail under severe loads.
 
 Our Double Ended Ram and Clevis Kits have a 6"", 8"", or 10"" stroke x 2.25"" bore x 1.125? rod.†The cylinder has a black zinc-plate finish while the rod has 3/4x16 female threads on each end and is made entirely out of 4340 chromoly material.
 
 The 6 inch ram and clevis kit has 6 total inches of travel and is perfect for Toyota's and narrowed Dana 44's.
 
 The 8 inch ram and clevis kit has 8 total inches of travel and was made to work with Dana 44's and custom length Dana 60 applications.
 
 The 10 inch ram and clevis kit has 10 total inches of travel and is used for buggies and comp rigs with up to 45 degree steering radius.

 The stock Toyota pump is just barely able to supply the volume and pressure needed to run Hydraulic assist steering. The stock pump puts out 1,300 PSI at only one gallon per minute. The stock pump is not able to provide enough fluid to run both the stock steering and the demands of a ram, especially at low RPM's. Drilling out the restrictor plates in a stock pump for more volume often leads to pump failure.
 
 The answer is a replacement ""TC"" style pump. The Trail-Gear Rock-Assault? pumps puts out either 1,450 or 1,650 PSI of pressure at 4 and 4.5 gallons per minute respectively. This provides the full fluid volume your steering box and ram are looking for, even at an idle.
 
 Pump kit includes your choice of 1,450 or 1,650 PSI pump, pump bracket, reservoir, reservoir bracket, belt, fittings, hoses, &amp; hardware. Pump kit is designed to work with stock or ram drilled IFS power steering boxes.
 
 Application Notes: This pump and bracket is designed to fit all Toyota 4cyl 4wd motors from 1979 - 1995. A large power steering fluid cooler (included) is required on the low pressure side of the system. Pump bracket works in conjunction with stock idler bracket. If your truck is not currently equipped with power steering, you will need to purchase the idler bracket and replace the steering gear box with one designed for use with power steering. The stock fan belt will not work with this pump and will need to be replaced with Napa #9430 belt. Belt is included with kit.

 †This is the perfect taper reamer for reaming out Toyota and Suzuki pitman arms for the larger, more commonly used FJ80 tie rod ends, like the ones offered in our popular high steer kits. Our taper reamer is 1:10 (1"" of taper for every 10"" of length) and is also expressed as 1.200"" TPF (1.200"" of taper for every foot of length). The reamer is made from M2 high speed steel with a 1/2"" shank diameter for drill press or mill and a 3/8"" square end for use with a tap wrench.
 
 Anyone can use this tool. You simply ream out the hole in the pitman arm until you can slide the shank of the TRE in, tighten the castle nut, and install the cotter pin. It takes just a few minutes and can be done with hand tools.",No,Tools - Specialized,http://precisionweldingoffroad:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/reamer.jpg

Knuckle Pull Scale,170004,11,3,"part# 170004
 
 A pull scale is helpful in setting up the shims on a knuckle. By increasing the shims above and below the knuckle the knuckle becomes tighter. When installing new knuckle bearings we recommend checking the shims with a pull scale. Attach the pull scale on the steering arm with the tie rod / drag link removed and the felt on the back side of the knuckle not yet installed. The knuckle should not move until about 15 lbs of force is applied to the steering arm.

Trail Safe Knuckle Seal And Rock Ring Kit, 140327-1-K,49,2,"part#††140327-1-K
 
 <a name=""wiper""></a>Tired of wiping big clumps of dirty sandy grease off of your knuckle balls after every trip? So are we. We asked our engineering department to look at the problems with the OEM design along with what was currently offered on the market and they came up with a one-piece, high grade polyurethane seal that is durable and will give you a lifetime of dependability.
 
 Trail Safe?Knuckle Ball Wiper Seals are without a doubt the best in the industry. No other design is comparable in performance and quality.
 
 The Trail Safe? Knuckle Ball Wiper Seal is a double sided seal that keeps grease in and dirt out, all while eliminating the use of the OEM felt and rubber. Since it is made from seal-grade polyurethane, not UHMW, the seal is pliable enough to stretch over the knuckle ball during installation. This eliminates the need to cut the seal for installation which allows water to enter the knuckle ball and for grease to escape.
 
 Trail Safe? Knuckle Ball Wiper Seals are sold in pairs with our legendary Rock Rings. One kit will complete one axle.",No,"knuckles|Vehicle Brands|Toyota|Steering|Toyota|Axles|Toyota 8""",http://precisionweldingoffroad:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trail-safe-knuckle-seal-kit.jpg

 <strong>Figure (C):</strong> The spring clip opens up under deflection and no longer supports the seal lip. A deflection gap will allow fluid to bypass the seal, resulting in a leak.

Magnum Studs For Toyota Steering Arms,140171-1,12,0.5,"part# 140171-1
 
 Trail-Gear Magnum knuckle studs are stronger then any other stock replacement Toyota knuckle stud on the market. These heavy-duty studs are manufactured to our specifications by world-renowned bolt manufacturer ARP (Automotive Race Products). Each stud is made from super tough, ARP 2000 material and is hardened to 220,000 PSI. Magnum studs are .250 (1/4?) longer than stock to accommodate all aftermarket steering arms. Each stud features an integrated 8mm hex head for easy removal with common tools you probably already carry in your tool bag. Don?t let knuckle stud failure ruin your day; get the best, Trail-Gear Magnum knuckle studs.
 
 We recommend using Locktight on the lower threads when installing knuckle studs. Studs should be tightened to 20-25 ft-lbs in the knuckles. Stud nuts should be tightened to 80 - 100 ft-lbs.

Trunion Bearing Eliminator Kit,140254-1-K,205.99,15,"part# 140254-1-K
 
 Anyone who wheels hard, rock crawls, or rock races has experienced blown up trunnion bearings, no matter what size bearings they are using, the bearing is always the point of failure. The Rock Assault? Trunnion Bearing Eliminator Kit totally eliminates the bearings and replaces it with a solid king pin style pin that sits in a hardened bushing. The pin and bushing are made out of a material that is considered bearing quality because of its high carbon content, which gives it extreme hardness. To make sure these pins provide you with smooth steering we have added zerk grease fittings and machined the pins with grease passages and grooves so that they can easily be lubricated without any disassembly of the steering knuckle.
 
 The Rock Assault? Trunnion Bearing Eliminator Kit can be installed in a matter of hours and does not require you sending us your steering arms to be machined. You simply press out the pins in your 4 or 6 stud steering arms and press in the provided Trunnion Bearing Eliminator pins. The bottom pins have been preinstalled in the bottom caps and simply drop in after the lower bushings have been installed. Since you will need to disassemble your knuckle assembly to complete this install a full knuckle service kit is provided so that you can replace all seals, gaskets, and shims.
 
 <strong>Note:</strong> Due to various machining tolerances in the current steering arms on the market, some slight reaming may be required.

Precision CNC machined, each knuckle is direct bolt on, heavy duty replacement.
 
 Six Shooter Knuckles are sold as a pair and include our set of special 6 hole shims for use between the top of the knuckle and the steering arm. Also included is a 1/2"" coarse thread bolt to help remove the steering arms for knuckle service. To remove the steering arms, remove all 6 nuts, then install the bolt in the top of the arm. As the bolt is tightened, the steering arm is pulled up off the knuckle. Stock lower bearing plates and shims from your old knuckles are needed for knuckle assembly. A minimum of four additional steering arm studs are needed for installation. No questions asked, lifetime warranty on all knuckles, arms, rod ends and rods.
